## Introduction

TripleUMDM (‚Äúwe,‚Äù ‚Äúour,‚Äù or ‚Äúus‚Äù) provides a mobile device management (MDM) and parental control service designed to give administrators, parents, and organizations powerful tools to monitor, configure, and manage devices. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle information when you use our services.

By using TripleUMDM, you agree to this Privacy Policy.

* Installed applications and usage information
* Location and network data
* Security and compliance status (rooted/jailbroken, etc.)
* User input as required by policies (e.g., login credentials, restrictions, permissions)

The scope of collected data is determined by the administrator who sets up the device.

We do not engage in any use of data that is unlawful, such as identity theft, financial fraud, or unauthorized resale of personal information.

## Administrator Control

The administrator (such as a parent, school, or organization) has broad control over how TripleUMDM is used on a device. This includes but is not limited to installing or removing apps, applying restrictions, collecting logs, enforcing screen time limits, and tracking device usage.

Users of a device managed by TripleUMDM should understand that the administrator determines what is monitored, blocked, or logged.

To the fullest extent permitted by law, we disclaim all liability for incidental, consequential, or punitive damages.

TripleUMDM may be used by parents or guardians to monitor and restrict devices used by children. We do not knowingly collect personal information directly from children without parental involvement. Responsibility for lawful use of the app rests with the administrator.
