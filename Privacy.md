Depending on configuration, TripleU MDM may collect and process the following:

- Device identifiers such as IMEI, Android ID, or serial numbers.
- Installed applications and usage information.
- Location and network data.
- Security and compliance status (for example, rooted or jailbroken indicators).
- User input required by policies (for example, login credentials, restrictions, or permissions).

We use collected information to:

- Provide device management and parental control features.

- Improve, debug, and maintain the app.
- Fulfill administrative or parental monitoring purposes.

We may expand or modify these uses as reasonably necessary to deliver and improve the service.

## Sharing of Information

We do not sell or share user information with third parties for advertising or unrelated commercial purposes. Information may be shared only in these cases:

1. With consent, if the administrator or account holder authorizes it.
2. For service operation, such as servers, cloud backups, or technical partners.
3. As required by law, if compelled by a lawful request.

We do not engage in unlawful use of data, including identity theft, financial fraud, or unauthorized resale of personal information.

## Administrator Control

The administrator (such as a parent, school, or organization) controls how TripleU MDM is used on a device. This includes installing or removing apps, applying restrictions, collecting logs, enforcing limits, and tracking device usage.

Users of a managed device should understand that the administrator determines what is monitored, blocked, or logged.

TripleU MDM is provided as is. We are not responsible for damages, losses, or claims arising from:

- How an administrator configures or uses the app.
- Data collected or actions enforced by an administrator.
- Device malfunctions, restrictions, or blocked functionality caused by use of the app.

To the fullest extent permitted by law, we disclaim liability for incidental, consequential, or punitive damages.

## Children's Privacy

TripleU MDM may be used by parents or guardians to monitor and restrict devices used by children. We do not knowingly collect personal information directly from children without parental involvement. Responsibility for lawful use of the app rests with the administrator.

We may update this Privacy Policy at any time. Continued use of TripleU MDM after changes are posted constitutes acceptance of the updated policy.
